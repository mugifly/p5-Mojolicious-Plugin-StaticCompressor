=head1 HELPERS

You can use these helpers on templates and others.

=head2 js $file_path [, ...]

Example of use on template file:

  <%= js '/js/foo.js' %>

However, this helper will output a HTML-tag including the URL which is a compressed files. 

  <script src="/auto_compressed/124015dca008ef1f18be80d7af4a314afec6f6dc"></script>

When this script file has output (just received a request), it is minified automatically.

Then, minified file are cached in the memory.

=head3 Support for multiple files

In addition, You can also use this helper with multiple js-files:

  <%= js '/js/foo.js', '/js/bar.js' %>

but, when these file has output, these are combined (and minified) automatically.

=head2 css $file_path [, ...]

This is just available as substitution for the 'stylesheet' helper (built-in helper of Mojolicious).

=head2 js_nominify $file_path [, ...]

If you don't want Minify, please use this.
